## About Me
An aspiring frontend developer with an interest in new technologies and eagerness to learn. I have ambitions to create new and innovative products. I have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The deeper I dive into development, the more interesting it gets. I realized that the internal logic of applications attracts me a bit more, so in time I plan to develop towards the backend as well.
